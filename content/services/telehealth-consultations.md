# Telehealth Consultations

Our telehealth consultations provide convenient, secure access to quality healthcare from the comfort of your home. Using state-of-the-art video conferencing technology, you can connect with our experienced healthcare professionals for a wide range of medical services.

## How It Works

1. **Schedule an Appointment**: Book your telehealth consultation through our online portal or by calling our office.
2. **Receive Confirmation**: You'll receive an email with your appointment details and a link to join the video consultation.
3. **Prepare for Your Visit**: Find a quiet, private space with good internet connection. Have your medical history, current medications, and any questions ready.
4. **Join Your Consultation**: Click the link in your confirmation email at the scheduled time to connect with your healthcare provider.
5. **Follow-Up Care**: Receive prescriptions, referrals, or follow-up appointments as needed after your consultation.

## Benefits of Telehealth

- **Privacy**: Consult with healthcare providers from the comfort and privacy of your own home
- **Reduced Exposure**: Minimize risk of exposure to contagious illnesses
- **Continuity of Care**: Maintain regular check-ups and follow-up appointments

## When to Use Telehealth

Telehealth consultations are ideal for:

- Follow-up appointments
- Prescription renewals
- Minor illnesses and injuries
- Chronic disease management
- Mental health consultations
- Medical questions and concerns

## When In-Person Care is Needed

- Conditions requiring physical examination
- Procedures or treatments that must be performed in-person
- Diagnostic tests that cannot be done remotely

## Insurance and Payment
