# Conclusion

The website development plan for Dr. Marina Gafanovich's practice is comprehensive and detailed, providing a solid foundation for implementation. With key decisions now made regarding design direction and technical platform, the project is ready to move forward with implementation.

## Decisions Made
- "Vibrant Miami Energy" design scheme has been selected
- Headless CMS + Next.js/React will be used as the technical platform
  - Headless CMS (Strapi, Contentful, or Sanity) for content management
  - Next.js/React for the frontend implementation
  - Improved performance, security, and development flexibility
- Telehealth services will be highlighted most prominently
- Russian language support will be implemented as a final step
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance will be maintained

## Current Next Steps
1. Begin Next.js development environment setup and headless CMS configuration
2. Implement the "Vibrant Miami Energy" design system using Tailwind CSS
3. Create placeholder content strategy for all sections
4. Develop "under construction" pages for features to be implemented later (patient portal, telehealth integration, etc.)
5. Implement local SEO strategy focusing on Miami-specific healthcare searches

The Tailwind CSS implementation guidance provides a starting point for developing the UI components needed throughout the site, ensuring consistency with the selected design direction while maintaining responsiveness across all device sizes.

With the focus on telehealth services and highlighting Dr. Gafanovich's Russian language capabilities, the website will effectively target the intended audience of adults ages 18-65 in the Miami area while differentiating the practice from competitors.
