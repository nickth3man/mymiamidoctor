## Project Overview

Dr. Marina Gafanovich's website will be developed using a headless CMS with Next.js/React frontend with the "Vibrant Miami Energy" design scheme. The primary marketing objectives are new patient acquisition and telehealth promotion, targeting adults ages 18-65. The website will comply with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.

### Key Features and Differentiators
- Telehealth services will be highlighted most prominently throughout the site
- Russian language support via a flag icon button (Dr. Gafanovich speaks Russian)
- Patient portal placeholder with "coming soon" page for future implementation
- Focus on Miami-specific healthcare searches for SEO strategy

### Development Approach
Content will be created at a later date, with placeholder strategy implemented during development. Third-party integrations for appointment booking, telehealth, and payment processing will also be decided later, with "under construction" placeholders implemented in the meantime.
