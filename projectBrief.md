# Roo Code Memory Bank: Project Brief

**Maintain Project Context Across Sessions and Memory Resets for Consistent AI-Assisted Development**

## Overview

The Roo Code Memory Bank system is designed to solve a critical challenge in AI-assisted development: maintaining context across sessions. By providing a structured memory system integrated with VS Code, it ensures your AI assistant maintains a deep understanding of your project across sessions and memory resets.

## Key Features

- **Persistent Context**: Remembers project details across sessions
- **Mode-Based Workflow**: Specialized modes for different development tasks
- **Real-Time Updates**: Continuous context synchronization
- **VS Code Integration**: Seamless development experience

## Core Components

1. **Memory Bank**: A directory containing structured markdown files that store project knowledge
2. **Mode Rules**: Configuration files (.clinerules-*) that define behavior for different modes
3. **Custom Modes**: Additional modes defined in .roomodes file
4. **Real-Time Updates**: System for keeping the Memory Bank synchronized with development progress

## Implementation Goals

1. Set up the Memory Bank system in our project
2. Configure all necessary rule files
3. Create core Memory Bank files
4. Verify the system works correctly
5. Document the system's functionality and usage

## Success Criteria

- Memory Bank system is properly set up and configured
- All core files are created and populated with relevant information
- The system correctly displays the Memory Bank status prefix
- Mode switching functionality works as expected
- Real-time updates to Memory Bank files are working correctly
