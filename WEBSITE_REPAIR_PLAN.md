# Miami Doctor Website Repair Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive, step-by-step plan to repair the Miami Doctor website and establish a solid foundation for future development. The website currently faces several critical issues including syntax errors, missing image resources, and client/server component architecture problems.

## Phase 1: Fix Critical Errors

### 1.1 Resolve Syntax Errors in Main Components
1. **Debug `app/page.tsx` syntax errors:**
   - Fix unmatched JSX brackets and fragment structure
   - Verify proper closing of all component tags
   - Ensure correct import statement syntax 
   - Check for trailing commas or improper line breaks causing parsing issues
   - Validate proper React fragment usage (`<>...</>`)

2. **Fix component structure in Home page:**
   - Properly balance opening and closing tags
   - Verify proper nesting of elements within sections
   - Check for any truncated code blocks at file endings
   - Ensure all component properties are correctly assigned

3. **Troubleshoot import statement issues:**
   - Validate all component imports resolve correctly
   - Ensure import paths are correct relative to file locations
   - Check for circular dependencies in component imports

### 1.2 Address Client Component Architecture
1. **Fix Next.js server/client component issues:**
   - Add `"use client"` directive at the top of all components using React hooks:
     - `components/forms/ContactForm.tsx` (already has it but check implementation)
     - `components/layout/NavBar.tsx` 
     - Any component using `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, etc.

2. **Review component hierarchy:**
   - Map out parent-child relationships of components
   - Identify which components must render on client vs server
   - Ensure client components aren't imported directly by server components

3. **Create client component boundary documentation:**
   - Document which components are client vs server for the team
   - Create visual diagram of component relationships
   - Define rules for future component development

### 1.3 Fix Missing Image Resources
1. **Create image placeholder system:**
   - Create directory structure: `/public/images/placeholders/`
   - Create standard placeholder images for different aspect ratios (1:1, 16:9, 4:3)
   - Implement placeholder SVGs with clear "placeholder" indicators

2. **Update HeroSection component:**
   - Modify to handle missing images gracefully
   - Create robust fallback UI for image loading failures
   - Implement proper alt text for accessibility

3. **Replace all image references:**
   - Update all hardcoded image paths throughout the codebase
   - Standardize image path references 
   - Create a central image path configuration file

## Phase 2: Restructure Component Architecture

### 2.1 Establish Consistent Component Library
1. **Create foundational UI components:**
   - **Button**: Create a unified Button component with variants:
     - Primary, secondary, outline, text-only
     - Loading states
     - Disabled states
     - Size variations (sm, md, lg)
   
   - **Typography**: 
     - Heading (h1-h6) with consistent styling
     - Paragraph with size variations
     - Caption and label components
   
   - **Layout primitives**:
     - Container with responsive constraints
     - Section with consistent spacing
     - Grid and flex layout components
     - Card components with various styles

2. **Implement design tokens system:**
   - Create a `styles/tokens.ts` file to define:
     - Color palette (primary, secondary, accent, neutral, semantic)
     - Typography scale (font sizes, weights, line heights)
     - Spacing scale (consistent spacing units)
     - Border radii, shadows, and transitions
   
3. **Build component documentation:**
   - Create usage examples for each component
   - Document props and variations
   - Create a component showcase page for development

### 2.2 Refine Form Components
1. **Rebuild ContactForm with proper validation:**
   - Implement form validation logic with clear error states
   - Create reusable input components (TextField, Select, Checkbox, etc.)
   - Add proper loading states for form submission
   - Implement success/error feedback UI

2. **Create form foundation components:**
   - Form container with consistent styling
   - Form field wrapper with label, input, error message
   - Input components with consistent styling
   - Validation system with common patterns

3. **Implement specialized forms:**
   - Appointment booking form with date/time selection
   - Patient information form with proper healthcare fields
   - Contact preferences form

### 2.3 Enhance Navigation System
1. **Rebuild NavBar component:**
   - Create mobile-responsive navigation with hamburger menu
   - Implement dropdown menu support for nested navigation
   - Add active state styling for current page/section
   - Create consistent styling with the rest of UI

2. **Create navigation utilities:**
   - Breadcrumb component for inner pages
   - Page transitions system
   - Navigation state management
   - Back/forward navigation helpers

3. **Implement site-wide navigation structure:**
   - Define primary navigation structure
   - Create secondary navigation patterns
   - Implement footer navigation

## Phase 3: Content Structure Development

### 3.1 Create Placeholder Content System
