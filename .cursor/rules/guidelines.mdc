# Incremental Verification Rule

## Core Principle
Every code change must be independently verifiable and validated before moving to the next change.

## Rule Requirements

For every code change implemented:

1. **Identify Clearly**: First clearly identify the specific issue or requirement being addressed
2. **Change Incrementally**: Make changes in small, testable increments
3. **Verify Immediately**: After each significant modification, verify the change works as expected
4. **Document Thoroughly**: Document both the change and the verification method used
5. **Confirm Before Proceeding**: Only proceed to the next improvement after confirming the current one is working correctly

## Benefits

This rule ensures that:
- Quality is maintained throughout the implementation process
- New issues are not introduced while fixing existing ones
- A clear audit trail of changes and their verification exists
- Sources of any problems can be easily identified
- The project remains in a functional state throughout the implementation

## Application
This rule applies to all code changes in the MyMiamiDoctor website project, including:
- Bug fixes
- Feature additions
- Refactoring
- Performance optimizations
- Structural improvements

## Verification Methods
Acceptable verification methods include:
- Manual testing with documented steps
- Automated tests (unit, integration, etc.)
- Build success verification
- UI validation against design requirements
- Cross-browser/device testing for UI changes

## Documentation Format
Each change should be documented with:
- Issue addressed
- Changes made
- Verification method
- Verification result
- Any relevant notes or observations
