## 2/27/2025 - Storage Cleanup Strategy

### Decision
Identified specific categories of files that can be safely deleted to reduce storage size, and created a PowerShell script (cleanup-storage.ps1) to automate the deletion process.

### Rationale
1. **Duplicate Files**:
   - `styles/forensic-findings.md` is an exact duplicate of the root `forensic-findings.md`
   - Keeping duplicate files wastes storage and creates confusion about which is the authoritative version

2. **Test and Example Pages**:
   - Pages like `app/accessibility-test`, `app/browser-compatibility`, etc. are development/testing resources
   - These pages are not needed in a production environment and should not be accessible to end users
   - They serve educational/reference purposes during development but add unnecessary weight to the final build

3. **Temporary or Backup Files**:
   - `app/page.tsx.new` appears to be a corrupted or incomplete backup file
   - The file contains binary characters and is not valid TypeScript/JSX
   - It likely was created during a file edit or merge operation and was not properly cleaned up

4. **Redundant Configuration**:
   - `styles/mymiamidoctor.code-workspace` is a VS Code workspace file in an incorrect location
   - Workspace files should be at the project root or in a dedicated .vscode directory
   - The path referenced in the file is incorrect, pointing to a different directory structure

5. **Duplicate Memory Bank**:
   - `roo-code-memory-bank/` appears to be a template or reference copy of memory bank files
   - The active memory bank is in the `memory-bank/` directory
   - Having two memory bank directories creates confusion and potential synchronization issues

### Implementation Approach
Created a PowerShell script with safety checks that:
1. Verifies each file/directory exists before attempting deletion
2. Provides clear feedback about what's being deleted
3. Handles errors gracefully
4. Includes documentation about the purpose of the cleanup

### Considerations
- The script does not delete any core application files or components
- All deleted files are either duplicates, testing resources, or temporary files
- If needed, files can be restored from version control
- The cleanup focuses on reducing storage size without affecting application functionality

## 2/27/2025 - Netlify CMS Integration

### Decision
Implemented Netlify CMS integration for content management with a client-side component approach and detailed documentation.

### Rationale
1. **Content Management Needs**:
   - The website requires a user-friendly way for non-technical users to update content
   - Content needs to be structured and consistent across the site
   - Multilingual content (English and Russian) needs to be managed efficiently

2. **Netlify CMS Benefits**:
   - Git-based content management (no database required)
   - User-friendly interface for content editors
   - Markdown and structured data support
   - Built-in media management
   - Editorial workflow for content review
   - Multilingual content support

3. **Integration with Next.js**:
   - Works well with static site generation and server-side rendering
   - Content stored as files in the repository
   - Compatible with the project's file-based content structure

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Headless CMS (Contentful, Sanity, etc.)**:
   - More powerful content modeling
   - Better for large teams and complex content structures
   - Requires external service and additional costs
   - More complex to set up and maintain

2. **Custom Admin Interface**:
   - Could be tailored exactly to project needs
   - Would require significant development time
   - Would need ongoing maintenance
   - No built-in editorial workflow or user management

3. **WordPress with REST API**:
   - Familiar interface for many content editors
   - Requires separate WordPress installation
   - More complex architecture with potential security concerns
   - Higher hosting and maintenance costs

### Implementation Approach
1. **Client-Side Integration**:
   - Created NetlifyCMS.tsx component for Netlify Identity integration
   - Dynamically imported in app/layout.tsx to avoid SSR issues
   - Added component to layout body for proper initialization
   - Configured to handle login/logout redirects

2. **Admin Interface Enhancement**:
   - Enhanced admin/index.html with improved styling and configuration
   - Added custom loading state with spinner for better UX
   - Implemented custom styling to match site branding
   - Added error handling for robustness
   - Registered preview styles to match the site's design

3. **Content Structure**:
   - Organized content into collections (blog, services, pages, settings)

   - Structured forms for consistent content entry
   - Media library for image management

3. **Developer Experience**:
   - Content changes tracked in version control
   - No additional database to manage
   - Clear separation between content and code
   - Easy to extend with custom widgets if needed

4. **Deployment Considerations**:
   - Works with the recommended Vercel hosting
   - No additional backend services required
   - Seamless integration with continuous deployment

## 2/27/2025 - Next.js Build Error Fix

### Decision
Fixed a Next.js build error in the contact page by removing the metadata export while keeping the "use client" directive, and relying on the separate metadata.ts file.

### Rationale
1. **Next.js Architecture Requirements**:
   - Next.js does not allow exporting metadata from a component marked with "use client"
   - The error was preventing the application from building successfully
   - The contact page needed client-side interactivity for the form functionality

2. **Metadata Management in Next.js**:
   - Next.js provides a pattern for separating metadata from client components
   - The project already had a separate metadata.ts file for the contact page
   - This separation follows Next.js best practices for app router architecture

### Implementation Approach
1. **Code Analysis**:
   - Identified the conflicting code in app/contact/page.tsx
   - Confirmed the existence of app/contact/metadata.ts with the required metadata
   - Verified that the metadata in both files was similar but not identical

2. **Solution Implementation**:
   - Removed the metadata import and export from app/contact/page.tsx
   - Kept the "use client" directive to maintain client-side functionality
   - Relied on the existing metadata.ts file for SEO and page metadata

3. **Documentation**:
   - Updated Memory Bank files to document the issue and solution
   - Added the fix to the progress tracking

### Considerations
1. **Next.js App Router Architecture**:
   - The app router in Next.js 13+ has specific patterns for metadata
   - Server components can export metadata directly
   - Client components must use separate metadata files
   - This architecture improves performance by keeping metadata on the server

2. **SEO Impact**:
   - Ensured that the contact page still has proper metadata for SEO
   - The metadata.ts file provides title, description, and keywords
   - No negative impact on search engine visibility

3. **Maintainability**:
   - The solution follows Next.js best practices
   - Makes the codebase more consistent with the framework's architecture
   - Reduces potential for similar errors in the future
