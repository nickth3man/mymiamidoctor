# Memory Bank: Decision Log

## 2/27/2025 - Website Hosting Provider Selection

### Decision
Selected Vercel as the recommended hosting provider for the MyMiamiDoctor website with a detailed step-by-step implementation plan documented in WEBSITE_HOSTING_PLAN.md.

### Rationale
1. **Next.js Optimization**:
   - Vercel is developed by the same team behind Next.js
   - Provides optimized deployment and runtime environment specifically for Next.js applications
   - Automatic handling of server-side rendering (SSR) and API routes

2. **Ease of Use**:
   - Simplest deployment process among all options considered
   - User-friendly dashboard suitable for clients with limited technical experience
   - Seamless GitHub integration for continuous deployment

3. **Performance and Reliability**:
   - Global edge network for fast content delivery
   - Automatic SSL certificate provisioning
   - High reliability and uptime guarantees
   - Built-in analytics and monitoring

4. **Cost-Effectiveness**:
   - Pro plan ($20/month) provides all necessary features for a professional healthcare website
   - No additional costs for SSL certificates or CDN services
   - Predictable pricing model

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Netlify**:
   - Very similar to Vercel in ease of use
   - Requires more configuration for Next.js specific features
   - Better form handling, but less optimized for Next.js

2. **DigitalOcean App Platform**:
   - More flexible but requires more technical knowledge
   - Less Next.js-specific optimization
   - Better for teams already using DigitalOcean services

3. **AWS Amplify**:
   - More powerful and customizable
   - Significantly more complex to set up and maintain
   - Better for enterprise-scale applications
   - Higher cost for comparable performance

4. **Traditional Web Hosting**:
   - Not well-suited for Next.js applications
   - Would require more complex deployment processes
   - Lacks automatic SSL, CDN, and other modern features

### Implementation Approach
1. Created a comprehensive hosting plan with:
   - Step-by-step instructions for domain connection
   - Detailed deployment process explanations
   - Configuration and optimization guidelines
   - Verification and testing protocols
   - Maintenance and support recommendations

2. Prioritized factors most important for a healthcare website:
   - Professional appearance and reliability
   - Security and regulatory compliance readiness
   - Performance for optimal user experience
   - Ease of maintenance for non-technical users

### Considerations
1. **Project Type**:
   - Next.js application requires hosting that properly supports SSR and API routes
   - Modern JavaScript application benefits from CDN and edge optimization

2. **Client Technical Expertise**:
   - Plan designed for users with limited technical experience
   - Emphasis on visual UI controls over command-line operations
   - Clear, step-by-step instructions with screenshots

3. **Healthcare Industry Requirements**:
   - Reliability and security are paramount for healthcare websites
   - Future backend integration considerations for patient data
   - Professional appearance to build patient trust

4. **Budget Considerations**:
   - Provided options at different price points
   - Focused on value rather than lowest cost
   - Emphasized return on investment from professional hosting

## 2/27/2025 - Storage Cleanup Strategy

### Decision
Identified specific categories of files that can be safely deleted to reduce storage size, and created a PowerShell script (cleanup-storage.ps1) to automate the deletion process.

### Rationale
1. **Duplicate Files**: 
   - `styles/forensic-findings.md` is an exact duplicate of the root `forensic-findings.md`
   - Keeping duplicate files wastes storage and creates confusion about which is the authoritative version

2. **Test and Example Pages**:
   - Pages like `app/accessibility-test`, `app/browser-compatibility`, etc. are development/testing resources
   - These pages are not needed in a production environment and should not be accessible to end users
   - They serve educational/reference purposes during development but add unnecessary weight to the final build

3. **Temporary or Backup Files**:
   - `app/page.tsx.new` appears to be a corrupted or incomplete backup file
   - The file contains binary characters and is not valid TypeScript/JSX
   - It likely was created during a file edit or merge operation and was not properly cleaned up

4. **Redundant Configuration**:
   - `styles/mymiamidoctor.code-workspace` is a VS Code workspace file in an incorrect location
   - Workspace files should be at the project root or in a dedicated .vscode directory
   - The path referenced in the file is incorrect, pointing to a different directory structure

5. **Duplicate Memory Bank**:
   - `roo-code-memory-bank/` appears to be a template or reference copy of memory bank files
   - The active memory bank is in the `memory-bank/` directory
   - Having two memory bank directories creates confusion and potential synchronization issues

### Implementation Approach
Created a PowerShell script with safety checks that:
1. Verifies each file/directory exists before attempting deletion
2. Provides clear feedback about what's being deleted
3. Handles errors gracefully
4. Includes documentation about the purpose of the cleanup

### Considerations
- The script does not delete any core application files or components
- All deleted files are either duplicates, testing resources, or temporary files
- If needed, files can be restored from version control
- The cleanup focuses on reducing storage size without affecting application functionality
