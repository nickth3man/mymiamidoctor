### 2/27/2025 - Netlify Deployment Guide Creation
- Created comprehensive NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md with detailed instructions for:
  1. Connecting GitHub repository to Netlify
  2. Configuring build settings (base directory, build command, publish directory, Node.js version)
  3. Setting up environment variables with security best practices

### 2/27/2025 - Netlify Build Dependency Resolution
- Encountered build error during Netlify deployment related to React version compatibility
- Identified dependency conflict between React 18.2.0 and netlify-cms-app which requires React 16 or 17
- Evaluated multiple solutions:
  1. Downgrading React (rejected due to significant codebase changes required)
  2. Using a different CMS (rejected as Netlify CMS integration was already implemented)
  3. Using npm's legacy peer dependencies flag (selected as least disruptive)
- Modified package.json build script to include `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` before running Next.js build
- Updated decisionLog.md with detailed rationale for the solution
- Updated activeContext.md to reflect the current deployment status
