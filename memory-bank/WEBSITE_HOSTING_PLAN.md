2. **Import Your Project**:
   - Click "Add new site"
   - Select "Import an existing project"
   - Choose "GitHub" as your Git provider
   - Select the MyMiamiDoctor repository
   - Netlify will detect the Next.js project

3. **Configure Project Settings**:
   - Keep the default build settings (Netlify should detect Next.js automatically)
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`
   - Click "Deploy site"

4. **Add Your Domain**:
