# Memory Bank: Active Context

## Current Task
Creating a comprehensive hosting plan for delivering the MyMiamiDoctor website to the client with professional hosting and domain setup.

## Approach
Based on the existing MyMiamiDoctor website (a Next.js application that is approximately 75% complete), I've developed a detailed hosting plan that prioritizes:
1. Professionalism
2. Reliability 
3. Simplicity (suitable for users with limited technical experience)

## Key Components of the Hosting Plan
1. **Hosting Provider Recommendations** - Detailed analysis of options at different price points
2. **Domain Connection Process** - Step-by-step instructions for connecting a domain
3. **Website Deployment Process** - Clear deployment procedures using Vercel
4. **Configuration and Optimization** - Settings for optimal performance and security
5. **Verification and Testing** - Comprehensive testing procedures
6. **Maintenance and Support** - Ongoing maintenance guidelines
7. **Timeline and Checklist** - Structured implementation timeline

## Primary Recommendation
Based on analysis of the Next.js codebase, Vercel is recommended as the optimal hosting provider due to:
- Native Next.js support (created by the same team)
- Simplified deployment process
- Enterprise-grade features at a reasonable price point
- Excellent reliability and performance
- User-friendly interface suitable for clients with limited technical experience

## Next Steps
1. Review the WEBSITE_HOSTING_PLAN.md document for comprehensive details
2. Determine if any additional hosting-specific requirements need to be addressed
3. Consider implementation needs that may require switching to Code mode
4. Update the Memory Bank with the client's feedback and any revisions to the plan
