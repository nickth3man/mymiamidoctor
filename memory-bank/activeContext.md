# Memory Bank: Active Context

## Current Task
Executing Netlify deployment tasks for the MyMiamiDoctor website, including connecting the GitHub repository, configuring build settings, setting up environment variables, and testing the deployment.

## Previous Tasks
1. Updating the website hosting plan to use Netlify instead of Vercel for deployment.
2. Fixing Next.js build errors in pages where both "use client" directive and metadata exports were present in the same file.
3. Implementing Netlify CMS integration for the MyMiamiDoctor website to enable content management through a user-friendly admin interface.

## Approach
Following a systematic deployment process for the MyMiamiDoctor Next.js application to Netlify, focusing on:
1. Proper GitHub repository connection
2. Correct build configuration
3. Secure environment variable setup
4. Comprehensive testing across devices and languages

## Key Components of the Deployment Process
1. **GitHub Integration** - Connecting the repository to Netlify
2. **Build Configuration** - Setting up the correct build parameters
3. **Environment Variables** - Configuring necessary environment variables
4. **Domain Setup** - Preparing for custom domain connection
5. **Testing Protocol** - Comprehensive verification of all functionality
6. **Post-Deployment Tasks** - Final configuration and optimization

## Implementation Progress
- Created NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md with comprehensive deployment instructions
- Verified netlify.toml configuration is properly set up with:
  - Build settings (base directory, publish directory, build command)
  - Environment variables
  - Redirects for API routes
  - Security headers
  - Asset optimization
- Confirmed Next.js configuration is compatible with Netlify deployment
- Verified package.json has the correct dependencies including netlify-cms-app
- Modified package.json build script to use `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to resolve dependency conflicts between React 18 and Netlify CMS
- Started the deployment process by connecting GitHub repository to Netlify
- Encountered and resolved build error related to React version compatibility with Netlify CMS
- Fixed package name issue by replacing @decapcms/app with netlify-cms-app in package.json

## Current Deployment Status
- GitHub repository successfully connected to Netlify
- Build settings configured according to the deployment guide
- Build process modified to handle dependency conflicts
- Deployment in progress with the updated configuration

## Next Steps
1. Complete the deployment process following the NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
2. Test the deployed website thoroughly across all pages and functionality
3. Verify multilingual support works correctly in the production environment
4. Confirm Netlify CMS is accessible and functioning properly
5. Set up Netlify Identity for user authentication
6. Update README.md with deployment information
