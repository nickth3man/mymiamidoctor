# Memory Bank: Active Context

## Current Task
Fixing Next.js build errors in pages where both "use client" directive and metadata exports were present in the same file.

## Previous Task
Implementing Netlify CMS integration for the MyMiamiDoctor website to enable content management through a user-friendly admin interface.

## Approach
Based on the existing MyMiamiDoctor website (a Next.js application that is approximately 75% complete), I'm implementing a comprehensive Netlify CMS integration that prioritizes:
1. User-friendly content management
2. Multilingual support (English and Russian)
3. Structured content organization
4. Seamless integration with the existing codebase

## Key Components of the CMS Integration
1. **NetlifyCMS Component** - Client-side component for Netlify Identity integration
2. **Admin Interface** - User-friendly interface for content management
3. **Content Configuration** - Structured content collections and fields
4. **Media Management** - Handling of images and other media files
5. **Editorial Workflow** - Content review and publishing process
6. **Authentication** - Secure access to the CMS

## Implementation Progress
- Created NetlifyCMS.tsx component for Netlify Identity integration
- Updated app/layout.tsx to include the NetlifyCMS component
- Created NETLIFY_CMS_INTEGRATION.md reference document
- Enhanced admin/index.html with improved styling and configuration
- Added NetlifyCMS component to the layout body
- Existing config.yml provides foundation for CMS content structure
- Fixed build errors in the following pages:
  - app/contact/page.tsx: Removed metadata export while keeping "use client" directive
  - app/patient-portal/page.tsx: Removed pageMetadata export while keeping "use client" directive

## Next Steps
1. Rewrite the README file
2. The user has decided to stop rewriting the commit messages
3. Test the CMS functionality
4. Create documentation for content editors
